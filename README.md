# Day-1:
## creating RESTFul API using FastAPI (Folder: Day_1)
Firstly we need to install 2 things
1. fastapi: pip install fastapi
2. uvicorn: pip install uvicorn
uvicorn is an ASGI server which would run our programs

RestFul API uses the http requests
popular requests methods are
GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
GET: Read Resource
POST: Create Resource
PUT: Update/Replace Resource
DELETE: Delete Resource

To run the application:
uvicorn Day_1.restful:app --reload

### Files:
restful.py: Contains the FastAPI application code

# Day-2
## Connecting Database with FastAPI to store details of books (Folder: Day_2)
For this we would be using SQLAlchemy and SQLite
SQLAlchemy is an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) for python which allows us to map Python objects to SQL tables and vice versa
SQLite is a database that stores data in a file, which is used to store data in a local database

Here we perform CRUD operations on our database
We need to install 2 things
1. sqlalchemy: pip install sqlalchemy
2. SQLite

### Files:
database.py: Contains the FastAPI application code
db.py: Contains the database code
models.py: Contains the database models

# Day-3

## FastAPI Application with NoSQL Database (MongoDB) (Folder: Day_3)
For this we would be using MongoDB
MongoDB is a NoSQL database which stores data in a JSON format

For using MongoDB, we would be using Atlas which is a cloud service for MongoDB

We need to install the following:
1. fastapi: pip install fastapi
2. uvicorn: pip install uvicorn
3. pymongo: pip install pymongo

To run the application:
uvicorn Day_3.mongo:app --reload

### Files:
mongo.py: Contains the FastAPI application code
config/mongo_db.py: Contains the MongoDB connection code
models/mongo_models.py: Contains the MongoDB models
schema/schemas.py: Contains the Pydantic schemas
routes/route.py: Contains the API routes

# Day-4

## FastAPI Application with PostgreSQL Database (Folder: Day_4)
Today we would be creating a quiz game using FastAPI and PostgreSQL. This application allows creating questions with multiple choices and retrieving them via API endpoints.

We need to install the following:
1. fastapi: pip install fastapi
2. uvicorn: pip install uvicorn
3. sqlalchemy: pip install sqlalchemy
4. psycopg2-binary: pip install psycopg2-binary (for PostgreSQL connection)
5. python-dotenv: pip install python-dotenv

Ensure you have a PostgreSQL database set up and configure the POSTGRES_DATABASE_URL in a .env file.

To run the application:
uvicorn Day_4.quiz:app --reload

### Files:
database.py: Contains the database connection setup using SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL.
models.py: Contains the SQLAlchemy models for Questions and Choices tables.
quiz.py: Contains the FastAPI application code with API endpoints for the quiz game.

# Day-5

## FastAPI Application with MySQL Database (Folder: Day_5)
Today we would be creating a blog application using FastAPI and MySQL. This application allows creating users and blog posts, retrieving them, and deleting them via API endpoints.

We need to install the following libraries:
1. fastapi: pip install fastapi
2. uvicorn: pip install uvicorn
3. sqlalchemy: pip install sqlalchemy
4. pymysql: pip install pymysql (for MySQL connection)
5. python-dotenv: pip install python-dotenv

Ensure you have a MySQL database set up and configure the environment variables (MYSQL_USERNAME, MYSQL_PASSWORD, MYSQL_HOST, MYSQL_PORT, MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME) in a .env file.

To run the application:
uvicorn Day_5.blog:app --reload

### API Endpoints:
- GET /users/{user_id}: Retrieve a user by ID
- GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieve a post by ID
- POST /users/: Create a new user
- POST /posts/: Create a new post
- DELETE /users/{user_id}: Delete a user by ID
- DELETE /posts/{post_id}: Delete a post by ID

### Files:
mysqldatabase.py: Contains the MySQL database connection setup using SQLAlchemy.
models.py: Contains the SQLAlchemy models for User and Post tables.
blog.py: Contains the FastAPI application code with API endpoints for the blog.
